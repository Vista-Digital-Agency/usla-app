        <p class="festContent">
          Once the Welcome Ceremony is over, please take a moment to walk into the newly renovated Surf & Rescue Museum. 
          Those who were here in the past will remember it as the Old Coast Guard Station, but now it is truly committed to 
          the lifeguards and ocean rescue. Adults and competitors alike will enjoy the history of surf lifesaving in Virginia Beach with a section dedicated to the USLA.
